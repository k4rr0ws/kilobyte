## About
Kilobyte.Farm is a farming project built on the PulseChain blockchain. 

## Farming
Farming is a fun DeFi concept and was one of the first style of projects in DeFi. Farming allows users to deposit liquidity (pair tokens) into the farming contract and earn a portion of the 
rewards (Emissions)

### What is a pair token? (LP)
Pair tokens or "LP" tokens are tokens that you get from providing liquidity on a decentralized exchange such as DexTop. How it works is you supply the required assets, for example KB and PLS will create the required KB/PLS pair token. When you create liquidity you provide equal value on either side: so if you're adding 1,000,000 PLS you will also need to provide 1,000,000 PLS worth of KB on the KB side. This is done through the Add Liquidity page. When you submit the transaction and supply the required liquidity, the factory then mints you a pair token that represents what you supplied. This pair token is what is required to deposit into the farming contract to receive rewards.
